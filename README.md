# 3d-visualizer-for-differential-eqn-in-2-variables

A *'3d graph visualizer'* for differential equations in 2 variables using **` Sympy `** library for Python
<br>

The application visualizes a 3D graph when provided with an apporpriate equation üìà.
<br>

### Tech/Framework used :

1. Language : Python
2. Code Editor : VS Code
3. Library : Sympy  
<br>

### Instructions :

You can clone the github repo and try out the application.

- make sure you have all the required libraries installed ‚¨áÔ∏è.
<br>

### Things implemented in this project :

1. Visualization of differential equations in 2 variables
2. Use of Sympy library<br>
<br>

> The user experience can be improved by adding GUI, Adding logic for visualizing several other types of equations .
